# Car_Price_End_to_End_Project
This end-to-end project is about predicting prices for the second hand cars.

If you would like to give this project a try then you can follow these steps:
1. Open 'Check_secondhand_car_prices_India.ipynb' notebook where you can see the main dataset being splitted into several other datasets.
  - Each splitted dataset belongs to a specific company.
  - There are multiple other Notebooks that are dedicated to single companies.
  - Note: There are many companies in this dataset as there wasn't enough data for that specific company I really had to drop them but you can add them as well.
2. Then get into other notebooks step by step and then created models and also EDA if you would really like to do as I have already done alot of EDA in other notebooks.
3. Then create pickle files for each and every model that you have created.
4. Use Flask to create a Web app. 
5. Finally deploy it using Heroku.
